                YouTubers constantly monitor the 
                feedback of their users with the goal of improving and
                 providing better content the type that the viewers want to see.
                 Youtubers may get feedback either from likes/dislikes
                  or from the comments.
                 Comments give better variety of feedback as compared 
                 to likes/dislikes.
                  Thus, automated approach has been proposed for 
                  better analyzing viewers comments.
                   We introduce YTCC (YouTube comment classifier) which 
                   classifies the viewers comments into 16 different 
                   categories based on their sentiments.
                    YTCC relies on BERT trained model to classify 
                    the comments into different categories to 
                    make it easy for content creators to have a 
                    vast and fast review of their video.
                 Which will help them change their content to become more better

                A desktop application that downloads YouTube media data. This
                includes a simple YouTube video, only audio, a cut version of video
                and audio, A cut version meaning that the user may give a start and
                the end time for the video and only that part will be downloaded
                instead of complete audio or video. For example, the user gives start
                time as 2:30 and end time as 3:30 the media downloaded will be a
                one-minute video/audio from 2:30 to 3:30.
